# Music-Genre-Classification-ML

## Description

This project aims to classify music genres based on audio features extracted from music samples. It includes data visualization, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Install the required libraries using the following command:
4. Run the script `music_genre_classification.py` to load the dataset and explore its contents.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is stored in a CSV file named `features_3_sec.csv`. It contains audio features extracted from music samples, including tempo, MFCCs, chroma features, and more.

## Usage

1. Load the dataset using the `load_data` function.
2. Explore the dataset using the `explore_data` function to visualize the distribution of tempo among different genres.
3. Implement machine learning algorithms for music genre classification, including Decision Tree, AdaBoost, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and KNN classifiers.
4. Evaluate the performance of each classifier using cross-validation and compare the results.
